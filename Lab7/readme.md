Using this code I implemented a file transfer application using TCP Sockets.

First run the server code file `TCPServer.java` and then the client code file `TCPClient.java`.

To run `TCPServer.java` type the following commands in the terminal.
```
javac TCPServer.java
java TCPServer
```

To run `TCPClient.java` type the following commands in the terminal.
```
javac TCPClient.java
java TCPClient
```

On executing file is read from Client and sent to Server to which server responds by sending each message received by echoing capitalised message read to the Client.
